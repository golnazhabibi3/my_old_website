I'm currently an Assistant Professor of Department of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma (known as OU). I am serving as a faculty of Computer Science and Data Science and Analytics Program at OU.
Previously, I was a Research Scientist and Postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. I have got my PhD in Computer Science from Rice University, Before joining MIT as a postdoc, I was a robotic engineer at Autel Robotics.

My research lies at the intersection of robotics, control, machine learning, and multi agent systems. My mission is to build a fully autonomous agent that learns to predict and interact, and acts effectively in dynamic complex environments, and ultimately works successfully individually or collaborates with other agents in a team. Moreover, my ultimate is to build and design agents with the capability of improving their performance by transferring their knowledge to new tasks and domains.
I believe to build an effective intelligent system for real world applications, both solid theory developement and complete implementation is necessary. My algorithmic solutions has been implemented on real robotics system and they have been applied to real-world problems such as autonomous driving, multi-agent task allocation, and collective transport.
